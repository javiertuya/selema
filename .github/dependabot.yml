  # Core .NET dependencies (MSTest, NUnit and Selenium) are declared as private assets to prevent propagation to the client
  # and must be kept to lower versions to prevent deprecation warnings/errors in the clients
  # However, it is not possible to have these dependencies not updated by dependabot (even setting them as ignore in a directory), 
  # because SelemaTest depends transitively on Selema. When dependabot updates SelemaTest, updates Selema too.
  # NOTE: When publish a new release, set back the Selema core dependencies to the lower versions, in v4.0.0.0 they are:
  # MSTest.TestFramework 4.0.0, NUnit 3.14.0, Selenium.WebDriver 4.37.0
